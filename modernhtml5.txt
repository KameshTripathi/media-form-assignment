The tabindex attribute in HTML is used to specify whether an element is focusable and its position in the tab order. The default value for tabindex is 0, which means that the element is focusable and will be included in the tab order. A value of -1 means that the element is not focusable and will not be included in the tab order. A positive value for tabindex specifies the position of the element in the tab order, with lower numbers being closer to the beginning of the tab order.

The tabindex attribute can be used on any HTML element, but it is most commonly used on form elements, such as input and select elements. By setting the tabindex attribute on these elements, you can make it easier for users to navigate through your form using the Tab key.
